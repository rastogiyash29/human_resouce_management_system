# **Full-Stack Coding Assignment – HRMS Lite**

## **Overview**

You are required to design and develop a **lightweight Human Resource Management System (HRMS Lite)**.

This assignment is intended to evaluate your **end-to-end full-stack development skills**, including:

* Frontend development  
* Backend API design  
* Database modeling & persistence  
* Error handling & validations  
* Deployment and production readiness

The scope is intentionally limited so that it can be completed **within 6-8 hours.**  
The focus should be on delivering a **clean, stable, and functional application**, not on building excessive features.

## **Problem Statement**

Build a **web-based HRMS Lite application** that allows an admin to:

* Manage employee records  
* Track daily attendance

The system should simulate a **basic internal HR tool**, focusing on essential HR operations with a **simple, usable, and professional interface**.

## **Functional Requirements**

### **1\. Employee Management**

The application should allow the admin to:

* Add a new employee with the following details:  
  * Employee ID (unique)  
  * Full Name  
  * Email Address  
  * Department  
* View a list of all employees  
* Delete an employee

**2\. Attendance Management**

The application should allow the admin to:

* Mark attendance for an employee with:  
  * Date  
  * Status (Present / Absent)  
* View attendance records for each employee

**Backend & Database Requirements**

* Implement **RESTful APIs** for all functionalities  
* Persist data using a **database** (SQL or NoSQL)  
* Perform **basic server-side validation**  
  * Required fields  
  * Valid email format  
  * Duplicate employee handling  
* Handle invalid requests and errors **gracefully**  
  * Proper HTTP status codes  
  * Meaningful error messages

## **Constraints & Guidelines**

* Assume a **single admin user** (no authentication required)  
* Leave management, payroll, and advanced HR features are **out of scope**  
* Frontend UI should resemble a **professional, production-ready website**  
* Expectations for UI:  
  * Clean layout  
  * Proper spacing  
  * Consistent typography  
  * Intuitive navigation  
* Use **reusable components**  
* Show meaningful UI states:  
  * Loading  
  * Empty states  
  * Error states  
* Code should be:  
  * Readable  
  * Modular  
  * Well-structured  
* The application should be **realistically usable**, not just a demo

## **Deployment (Mandatory)**

You **must deploy** the application and share:

1. **Live Frontend URL**  
   * The application must be publicly accessible  
2. **Hosted Backend API**  
   * Backend must be deployed  
   * Frontend should be connected to the live backend  
3. **GitHub Repository Link**  
   * Must contain the complete source code (frontend \+ backend)

⚠️ **Important:**  
The deployed application should run **without errors** using the shared links.

## **Submission Requirements**

Please submit the following:

1. **Live Application URL**  
2. **GitHub Repository Link**  
3. **README.md** file containing:  
   * Project overview  
   * Tech stack used  
   * Steps to run the project locally  
   * Assumptions or limitations (if any)

## **Bonus (Optional)**

You may implement one or more of the following:

* Filter attendance records by date  
* Display total present days per employee  
* Basic dashboard summary (counts or tables)

Bonus features will be considered **only if the core functionality is complete and stable**.

## **Recommended Tech Stack (Flexible)**

You are free to choose your stack. Example:

### **Frontend**

* JavaScript  
* React / Angular / Vue

### **Backend**

* Python: Django / FastAPI

### **Database**

* MongoDB  
  **OR**  
* PostgreSQL / MySQL

### **Deployment**

* Vercel / Netlify (Frontend)  
* Render / Railway /(Backend)

**Time Expectation**

* Estimated completion time: **within 6-8 hours**  
* Over-engineering is **not required**  
* A **clean, working solution** is preferred over extra features

## **Important Note**

This assignment is designed to assess **practical full-stack development skills**.

* Incomplete implementations  
* Missing deployments  
* Broken links or non-working applications

may result in the assignment **not being evaluated**.

### **Good Luck\!**

We look forward to reviewing your solution 🚀
